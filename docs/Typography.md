# Typography

Good typography can help build a visual hierarchy, make text easier to read, and communicate a brand’s personality. We use typography to communicate our values.

We have used the font Fredoka . Fredoka is a big, round, bold font that is perfect for adding a little fun to any headline or large text.

The initial Latin component was designed by Milena Brandão. The later Hebrew component was designed by Ben Nathan.

This font is the upgrade to variable font (with a width and weight axes) of Fredoka One.

The Fredoka project is led by Ben Nathan, a typeer design foundry based in Israel.
