# Brand Guidelines

Our brand is a reflection of who we are as a company and what we represent in the world of work.

Tilli brand has been designed to engage kids to learn Social Emotional Learning (SEL) and to build core SEL competencies.
The Brand language is towards fun entertainment. Hence the design has got rounded corners.
 
We have designed carefully to avoid sharp corners/edges in our design(Logo, Typography, Characters).
