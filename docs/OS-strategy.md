# OS Strategy

## Tilli’s Open Source Strategy

We want to share our learnings, content templates and tools to help other educators and content creators to develop social emotional learning experiences and to also localise Tilli’s content to ensure we are accessible to diverse communities and languages. 

### Our approach: 

We have open sourced the following Tilli modules so that other content creators can expand on our learning experience and use our templates, game mechanics and strategies to build other social emotional learning tools or to translate our content: 

Module 1: Recognizing Feelings and Emotions 

Module 2: Understanding Trust

Module 3: Digital Safety

Each module has specific modules, user flows, and mini games that can be repurposed.

##### Module 1:
Emotion recognition module: allows the user to pick their current emotion/feeling
Voice input module: allows the user to record multiple voice inputs 
Mini games: This module 6 mini games that use strategies like meditation, yoga and breathing activities. These have been built on Godot.

##### Module 2: 
Learning module: A series of learning cards 
Trust circle case studies: A series of stories, that users read and then get to drag and drop where each new character will be on a trust circle 
Leaderboard 

#### Content Management System 

We also have a content management system that allows creators to use some of the core components found in the 3 modules to build their own gamified, learning experiences in the form of web apps.
